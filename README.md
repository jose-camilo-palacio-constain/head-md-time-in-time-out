# SHAPES OF TIME 

This is the process folder describing my progress throughout the semester


## Investigation progress (3/11/2022) 

## SHAPES OF TIME / STRUCTURE:

- I am in the countryside in the middle of the night and a light appears on the horizon, it is like a flame dancing in the wind, it is a guaca! I have decided to look for it and find the treasure hidden in it!

- Please draw the route you would take to get to the guaca thinking about time in a cyclical, spiral or labyrinth form.

## RESULTS OF THE SURVEY:

## Investigation progress (2/11/2022) 

## PERCEPTION ABOUT THE CONCEPTS: 

Looking for the union of concepts, I propose to develop Amerindian labyrinths in which the theme of "guacas or huacas" is worked on.

![SHAPES OF TIME 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116269310/199702102-b8117a73-b76a-4a88-b28f-5e25c9cc84d1.jpg)
![SHAPES OF TIME 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116269310/199702130-fd1ca303-8bfe-4e50-9af1-6c067ee3272d.jpg)



## PROPOSED ACTIVITY: 
It would be very interesting for people to draw some of the non-linear representations of time that have been chosen. Alexia recommends doing about 20 surveys in which people express their ideas through drawings.

## SURVEY DURATION: 
Between 30- and 5-minutes seconds per survey.

## STRUCTURE:
1. Write the question.
2. Post a graph or diagram.

## QUESTIONS:
How would you draw or represent these nonlinear forms of representation about time: cyclic time, spiral time, and time represented through mazes?

Connect the stories about the guacas with the three forms of non-linear representation of time. Tell a story: I am in the field, and a light appears on the horizon, it is like a flame dancing in the wind, then I decide to follow it hoping to find the treasure. Please draw the field using spirals. Draw the path you can take..., draw the shape of the light using ..., tell the story and then draw it.

Spiral mazes.

PLUNGE / ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT

London has a great history of public sculpture. Many of these monuments are often overlooked by the city’s residents as they go about their daily business. At a moment when discussions about climate change are omnipresent, the visual images associated with this issue tend to show vulnerable landscapes from around the world, but the situation for cultural landmarks at the heart of this metropolis is equally precarious. Plunge encircled noteworthy monuments in London with an illuminated blue line, showing the predicated sea level in the year 3012. At one level the viewer could extend an imaginary line between the monuments placing themselves deep below the water’s surface, at another level the illumination suggests a protective shell proposing that we still have chance to change this situation.

**FIBONACCI SEQUENCE / CYCLES OF NATURE, NATURAL SCALE**

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fₙ, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PASCAL’S TRIANGLE (VPM) / ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT**

**PROBABILITY**

Pascal's Triangle is an arithmetical triangle and is commonly used in probability. The row number to observe depends on how many objects there are in total. The number along the row represents the number of different combinations you can get, depending on how many objects you choose from the total.

**APPLICATION**

Pascal’s triangle is used widely in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. Generally, we can use Pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of binomial expansion, to find the probability of heads and tails in a toss, in combinations of certain things, etc.

**AMERINDIAN MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS / NONLINEAR TIME PROCESS**

**MOLAS AND LABYRINTHS**

The theme that is often repeated in most molas is the image of the labyrinth. The Kuna Indians believe that man, the exuberant tropical vegetation, and animals are constantly brought together through complex paths.

**THE MOLAS AND DUALITY**

One of the very significant elements of the molas is their DUALITY (they are made up of two phases), an important issue for many Amerindian societies. According to the beliefs of the Kuna Indians, all beings have their purba (double, hidden essence, soul): human beings, animals, plants, objects, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ITERATION:** is the repetition of a process in order to generate a sequence of outcomes. Each repetition of the process is a single iteration, and the outcome of each iteration is then the starting point of the next iteration. In mathematics and computer science, iteration is a standard element of algorithms. 

![ITERATIVE PROCESS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116269310/197971970-32652ae9-08f8-4ce7-a2cd-5c82f879d862.png)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Biomechanics:** was a system of actor training developed by Vsevolod Meyerhold. Its purpose was to widen the emotional potential of a theater piece and express thoughts and ideas that could not be easily presented through the naturalistic theater of the period. 


![BIOMECHANIC METHOD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116269310/197972043-947160d6-814b-46d0-8fcf-67e123e04eaf.jpg)

**Metronome:** device that produces a regular repeated sound like a clock, to help musicians play music at a particular speed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sleep paralysis:** happens when you cannot move your muscles as you are waking up or falling asleep. This is because you are in sleep mode but your brain is active. It's not clear why sleep paralysis can happen but it has been linked with: insomnia.
