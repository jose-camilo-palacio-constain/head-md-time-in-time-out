PLUNGE / ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT

London has a great history of public sculpture. Many of these monuments are often overlooked by the city’s residents as they go about their daily business. At a moment when discussions about climate change are omnipresent, the visual images associated with this issue tend to show vulnerable landscapes from around the world, but the situation for cultural landmarks at the heart of this metropolis is equally precarious. Plunge encircled noteworthy monuments in London with an illuminated blue line, showing the predicated sea level in the year 3012. At one level the viewer could extend an imaginary line between the monuments placing themselves deep below the water’s surface, at another level the illumination suggests a protective shell proposing that we still have chance to change this situation.

**FIBONACCI SEQUENCE / CYCLES OF NATURE, NATURAL SCALE**

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fₙ, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2.

**PASCAL’S TRIANGLE (VPM) / ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT**

**PROBABILITY**

Pascal's Triangle is an arithmetical triangle and is commonly used in probability. The row number to observe depends on how many objects there are in total. The number along the row represents the number of different combinations you can get, depending on how many objects you choose from the total.

**APPLICATION**

Pascal’s triangle is used widely in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. Generally, we can use Pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of binomial expansion, to find the probability of heads and tails in a toss, in combinations of certain things, etc.

**AMERINDIAN MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS / NONLINEAR TIME PROCESS**

**MOLAS AND LABYRINTHS**

The theme that is often repeated in most molas is the image of the labyrinth. The Kuna Indians believe that man, the exuberant tropical vegetation, and animals are constantly brought together through complex paths.

**THE MOLAS AND DUALITY**

One of the very significant elements of the molas is their DUALITY (they are made up of two phases), an important issue for many Amerindian societies. According to the beliefs of the Kuna Indians, all beings have their purba (double, hidden essence, soul): human beings, animals, plants, objects, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ITERATION:** is the repetition of a process in order to generate a sequence of outcomes. Each repetition of the process is a single iteration, and the outcome of each iteration is then the starting point of the next iteration. In mathematics and computer science, iteration is a standard element of algorithms.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Biomechanics:** was a system of actor training developed by Vsevolod Meyerhold. Its purpose was to widen the emotional potential of a theater piece and express thoughts and ideas that could not be easily presented through the naturalistic theater of the period. 


![BIOMECHANIC METHOD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116269310/197972043-947160d6-814b-46d0-8fcf-67e123e04eaf.jpg)

**Metronome:**device that produces a regular repeated sound like a clock, to help musicians play music at a particular speed.
