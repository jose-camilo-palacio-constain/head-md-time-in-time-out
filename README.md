PLUNGE / ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT

London has a great history of public sculpture. Many of these monuments are often overlooked by the city’s residents as they go about their daily business. At a moment when discussions about climate change are omnipresent, the visual images associated with this issue tend to show vulnerable landscapes from around the world, but the situation for cultural landmarks at the heart of this metropolis is equally precarious. Plunge encircled noteworthy monuments in London with an illuminated blue line, showing the predicated sea level in the year 3012. At one level the viewer could extend an imaginary line between the monuments placing themselves deep below the water’s surface, at another level the illumination suggests a protective shell proposing that we still have chance to change this situation.

FIBONACCI SEQUENCE / CYCLES OF NATURE, NATURAL SCALE

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fₙ, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2.

PASCAL’S TRIANGLE (VPM) / ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT

PROBABILITY

Pascal's Triangle is an arithmetical triangle and is commonly used in probability. The row number to observe depends on how many objects there are in total. The number along the row represents the number of different combinations you can get, depending on how many objects you choose from the total.

APPLICATION

Pascal’s triangle is used widely in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. Generally, we can use Pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of binomial expansion, to find the probability of heads and tails in a toss, in combinations of certain things, etc.

AMERINDIAN MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS / NONLINEAR TIME PROCESS

MOLAS AND LABYRINTHS

The theme that is often repeated in most molas is the image of the labyrinth. The Kuna Indians believe that man, the exuberant tropical vegetation, and animals are constantly brought together through complex paths.


THE MOLAS AND DUALITY

One of the very significant elements of the molas is their DUALITY (they are made up of two phases), an important issue for many Amerindian societies. According to the beliefs of the Kuna Indians, all beings have their purba (double, hidden essence, soul): human beings, animals, plants, objects, etc.
