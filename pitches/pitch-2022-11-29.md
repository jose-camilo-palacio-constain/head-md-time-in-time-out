# PITCH TITLE
## LA GUACA / SHAPES OF TIME 

The key idea of this narrative is based on the story of a farmer who starts a journey through a labyrinth in search of a "Guaca". The labyrinth is governed by supernatural Amerindian energies that control time in different ways.

As the character advances through the labyrinth and gets closer to the treasure hidden in the Guaca, he is immersed in a quest full of mysteries and obstacles that inevitably transport him to new scenarios that take him to initial or intermediate stages of his journey, preventing him from reaching his goal and leading him into a complex quest.

## KEY INSIGHT

How Amerindian cultures interpreted time.
