# SHAPES OF TIME / FORMAS DEL TIEMPO

## KEY INSIGHT

The key insight of this research is focused on analyzing and representing through objects some non-linear forms of time. To carry out this project, three non-linear geometric representations of time immersed in the cosmogony or ways of interpreting the reality of the Amerindian cultures that inhabited the American continent were considered: Cyclic time, spiral time, and labyrinths.
