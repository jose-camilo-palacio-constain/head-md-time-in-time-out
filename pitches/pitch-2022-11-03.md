## Investigation progress (3/11/2022) 

## SHAPES OF TIME / STRUCTURE:

- I am in the countryside in the middle of the night and a light appears on the horizon, it is like a flame dancing in the wind, it is a guaca! I have decided to look for it and find the treasure hidden in it!

- Please draw the route you would take to get to the guaca thinking about time in a cyclical, spiral or labyrinth form.
