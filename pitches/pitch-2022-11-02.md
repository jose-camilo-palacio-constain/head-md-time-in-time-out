## SHAPES OF TIME / FORMAS DEL TIEMPO 

## KEY INSIGHT 02

The key idea of this research is focused on analyzing and representing through objects some non-linear forms of time present in the cosmogony of the Amerindian cultures that inhabited the American continent. In order to carry out this project, three non-linear geometric representations of time existing in Amerindian cultures were considered: Cyclic time, spiral time, and labyrinths.

From an anthropological point of view, cyclical time expresses the beginning, the knot, the denouement, and the transcendence of man's life in an elliptical and iterative representation that can be interpreted in small or very long periods of time that are constantly repeated.

Spiral time represents another view of biological growth, natural events, and animal anatomy.

Finally, the labyrinths intertwined in timelines represented through "Molas" by the Kuna culture, reflect complex pathways in which communities and the exuberant flora and fauna are linked.

## SENTENCES

- The shapes of time outside the West.
- Anthropology (Amerindian cosmogony) and geometry.
- Pre-Columbian crafts and city diagrams and technological devices.


## PERCEPTION ABOUT THE CONCEPTS: 

Looking for the union of concepts, I propose to develop Amerindian labyrinths in which the theme of "guacas or huacas" is worked on.

## PROPOSED ACTIVITY: 
It would be very interesting for people to draw some of the non-linear representations of time that have been chosen. Alexia recommends doing about 20 surveys in which people express their ideas through drawings.

## SURVEY DURATION: 
Between 30- and 5-minutes seconds per survey.

## STRUCTURE:
1. Write the question.
2. Post a graph or diagram.

## QUESTIONS:
How would you draw or represent these nonlinear forms of representation about time: cyclic time, spiral time, and time represented through mazes?

Connect the stories about the guacas with the three forms of non-linear representation of time. Tell a story: I am in the field, and a light appears on the horizon, it is like a flame dancing in the wind, then I decide to follow it hoping to find the treasure. Please draw the field using spirals. Draw the path you can take..., draw the shape of the light using ..., tell the story and then draw it.

Spiral mazes.
