# PITCH TITLE
## SHAPES OF TIME / FORMAS DEL TIEMPO 

## KEY INSIGHT 02

The key idea of this research is focused on analyzing and representing through objects some non-linear forms of time present in the cosmogony of the Amerindian cultures that inhabited the American continent. In order to carry out this project, three non-linear geometric representations of time existing in Amerindian cultures were considered: Cyclic time, spiral time, and labyrinths.

From an anthropological point of view, cyclical time expresses the beginning, the knot, the denouement, and the transcendence of man's life in an elliptical and iterative representation that can be interpreted in small or very long periods of time that are constantly repeated.

Spiral time represents another view of biological growth, natural events, and animal anatomy.

Finally, the labyrinths intertwined in timelines represented through "Molas" by the Kuna culture, reflect complex pathways in which communities and the exuberant flora and fauna are linked.
