## PITCH TITLE
LA GUACA / SHAPES OF TIME 

## KEY INSIGHT 03 

The key idea of this narrative is based on the story of a farmer who begins a journey through parallel worlds or multiverses in search of the treasure hidden in a "Guaca". These worlds are governed by supernatural Amerindian energies that control time in different ways (cyclical, spiral and labyrinth forms).

As the character advances and approaches the treasure hidden by the Guaca, he is immersed in a looping journey that irremediably transports him to a new world or scenario that takes him to initial or intermediate stages of his journey, preventing him from reaching his goal, in a "never-ending" quest.
